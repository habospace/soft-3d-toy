# Soft-3d-toy:

This is a soft 3d engine written in Java.

The project was made to learn about Java Programming as well as learn the basics of a 3d engine:

  - Matrix projections
  - triangle rasterization
  - texture mapping to surfaces
  - surface normal vector based shading
  - depth buffering techniques (painter's algorithm and backface culling)

The repository has the following structure:
